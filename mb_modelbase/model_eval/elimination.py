def eliminate(model, df, elim_dims, **kwargs):
    """ Eliminate influence on data in one representation from certain dimensions in the other representation.

    Elimination provides a forward and backward mode.

    Forward mode: This means you eliminate the influence of original dimensions on the DR projection. It aims
    answer questions like:
     * 'How would the DR projection look like if there is no information on dimension X available?',
        (marginalization)
     * 'How would the DR projection look like if all values of X are set to value a?' (conditioning)

    Backward mode: Like forward mode but removes the influence of projected dimensions on the original data
    space.

    Note: self is the model.

    Args:
        model : Model
            The model to use for elimination
        df : Pandas DataFrame
            The data from which to eliminate influence
        elim_dims : single or sequence of scalar conditions or dimension names.
            The dimensions to eliminate, either using marginalization or conditioning on a common value.
            If dimension names are given, marginalization is used. If conditions are given, conditining is
            used.

    Return:
        A dataframe with identical shape like `df` but with any influence of `elim_dims` removed.

    Raises:
        ValueError :
            If `df` and `elim_dims` share any dimensions, or
            if `elim_dims` holds conditions, but not conditioning on a single value.
