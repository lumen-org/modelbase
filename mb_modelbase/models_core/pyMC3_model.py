class ProbabilisticPymc3Model(Model):
    """A Bayesian model built by the PyMC3 library is treated here.
    General principles:

    The heart of this class is the generation of posterior samples during the _sample() method. It uses the PyMC3
    functions sample() and sample_ppc() to generate samples for both latent and observed random variables, and store
    them in a pandas dataframe where columns are variables and rows are associated samples. Fitting the
    model essentially means just generating those samples. Computing a probability density for the model is then done by
    setting up a kernel density estimator over the samples with the scipy.stats library and getting the density from
    this estimator. Marginalizing means just dropping columns from the dataframe, conditioning means just dropping
    rows that do not meet a certain condition. Three things to keep in mind for the conditioning:
        - Conditioning in the actual sense of conditioning on one single value is not feasible here: If we have
          continuous variables, none of the samples probably has this value, so all samples would be discarded. However
          for the current implementation it is only necessary to condition on intervals, so that is currently not a
          problem
        - However a similar problem appears if we have a high-dimensional model and want to condition on a small area
          within that high-dimensional space. Then it is very likely that again none of the samples fall in this space
          and again, all samples would be discarded. We do not have a solution for this yet.
        - Keep in mind that the _conditionout() method does not only condition, but additionally marginalizes variables
          out. There is no method that only conditions the model

    A model is allowed to include independent variables, that is, variables that are not modeled but whose values
    influence observed variables. If a model contains independent variables, values for them are generated after
    the latent variables were sampled and before the observed variables are sampled. The values for the independent
    variables are drawn without replacement from the training data. Setting new values for independent variables is not
    so easy, since they are actually hardcoded within the PyMC3 model, which cannot easily be changed once submitted
    to the Wrapper class of the modelbase backend. To work around this, independent variables have to be transformed to
    theano shared variables and given to the wrapper class as a separate argument. Then it is possible to change their
    values again after the model was specified.

        Parameters:

            model_structure : a PyMC3 Model() instance

            shared_vars : dictionary of theano shared variables

                If the model has independent variables, they have to be encoded as theano shared variables and provided
                in this dictionary, additional to the general dataframe containing all observed data. Watch out: It is
                NOT guaranteed that shared_vars always holds the original independent variables, since they are changed
                during the _fit()-method

            nr_of_posterior_samples: integer scalar specifying the number of posterior samples to be generated

            fixed_data_length: boolean, indicates if the model requires the data to have a fixed length

                Some probabilistic models require a fixed length of the data. This is important because normally
                new data points are generated with a different length than the original data

            data_mapping: dict or DataTypeMapper, optional. Defaults to the identify mapping.

                The actual probabilistic modelling may require that you encode variables differently than you want to
                expose them to the outside. E.g. a variable may be modelled as an integer value of 0 or 1 but actually
                it represents the sex of a person ('male' or 'female'). Here you specify such mappings between the
                original space and the modeling space.

                Note that you must provide your training and test data in its original space representation with
                .fit_data().

            sampling_chains: int, optional. Defaults to 1.

                See https://docs.pymc.io/api/inference.html and there the paramter chains of .sample()

            sampling_cores: int, optional. Defaults to 1.

                See https://docs.pymc.io/api/inference.html and there the paramter cores of .sample()

            probabilistic_program_graph: dict, optional. Defaults to None.

                The graph of the probabilistic program this model is based on. This only makes sense in the special
                case where the PyMC3 program is derived automatically from a bayesian network. The graph represents
                the data flow in the network, but also contains information about the user defined constrains that
                were taken into account when learning the bayesian network. It is a dict organized as follows:

                'nodes': list of strings.
                    Name of every node of the graph. It includes all nodes, also the enforced ones below.

                'edges': 2-tuple of strings
                    Directed edges of the graph as pairs of nodes. It includes all edges, even the forbidden ones.

                'enforced_node_dtypes': dict of <node name: dtype>, where dtype maybe 'numerical' or 'string'. Optional.

                'enforced_edges': list of edges. Optional.
