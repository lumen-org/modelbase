This module provides basic types required for describing and working with models and data, in particular:

    * Field: an attribute/dimension/random variable

    * Field Usages: An usage of a (number of) Fields to derive a (set of) values/intervals

        * Aggregation: Aggregation of one or more fields. In a sense it is a summary across the given fields.

        * Split: Splits divide the domain of the referenced (single) field and generate a set of values/intervals of
        the domain of the field. Typcially, this is done because input values of that field are required.

        * Density/Probability: Is a particular type of aggregation that represent queries for the density
        value/probability.

    See below for details!
