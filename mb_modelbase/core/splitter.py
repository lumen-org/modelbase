"""
This is the splitter module, which provides splitters and domains:
Splitters are functions that receive a domain and a number of parameters and 
return a split of the domain into subdomains.

Note that not all splitters work with all domains. See the documentation of
each for more.


Scalar or interval-valued return values

    Splits return different _types_ of values:
     * scalars (i.e. single elements of the splitted domain), or
     * domains  (i.e. a tuple, such as (min, max) for quantitative domains, or (el1, el2) for categorical domains)

    The return type different between the split functions, and in the future there may be flags to configure what to
    return. Note, that generally and 'up-cast' is possible, i.e. returning a domain instead of a scalar.

TODO:
    need to clean up domains. documentation of functions and their implementation does not match. Also, we lack
    a good strategy to distinghuish scalar and domain-values splits and how to deal with them in predict.
