class FixedMixtureModel(md.Model):
    """An abstract mixture model, i.e. a compound model that consists of n model types (models[i].class) with a
    particular model class occurring models[i].n many times.

    # Reduction to compontent models:
    It is however easy to implement since it is straightforward to reduce most of mixture models functionality to the
     (provided) functionality of its individual components:

      * conditioning
      * marginalizing
      * density
      * copy

    Other functionality, however, is not generically reducible. Hence this is must be implemented by specific mixture subclasses:

      * fitting a mixture model
      * setting its data
      * aggregations

    However, for the maximum aggregation there is a simple, generic heuristic implemented. See _maximum_naive_heuristic.

    # internal performance note:
    This is a naive implementation of mixture models that tries to reuse as much of existing model classes as possible.
     It avoids duplicated storage of a models data and other state variables of an abstract model. This works by
     linking the the components state to the state of the fixed_mixture_model, which inherits from model and hence
     maintains it own state.
     It also uses the internal model api, i.e. _marginalizeout and _conditionout of the components, as we can make
      guarantees on the correctness of the parameters.

    However, notice that each component nevertheless needs to maintain its own set of internal auxiliary variables.

    Future: A discussion with Matthias led to the conclusion that we probably should create independent classes
    for data and fields. This would improve code quality and would most likely also help to manage these in the
    context of mixture models.

    components:
        meaning: The mixtures models components.
        data structure: a dict that maps the class name (MyModelClass.__name__) to a tuple of actual models of that
            class

    _unbound_component_updater:
        function that can be called to maintain internal state. Call to it is equivalent to
        calling self._update_in_components()

    [i]:
        meaning: access individual mixture components by numerical indexing.

    len():
        meaning: get the number of components by calling len on the mixture.

    iter:
        meaning: iterate over the mixture to access the components one after another.
