##Where to get Documentation 
Documentation for the lumen project is provided as:

 * jupyter notebook (in this directory) that explain and showcase how to use some functionality or to solve some task. This is the recommended way to get started. You can also use the notebook as a basis for your own scritps and analyses.
 * code documentation in the source code. In the future we will setup the automatic generation of a web-based documentation from this, however, at the moment please refer to the code itself.
 * you are very(!) welcome to write an email to philipp.lucas@dlr.de if you have a question
 * you are also very welcome to contribute issue to the github issue tracker
