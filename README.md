A SQL-like interface for python and the web to query data together with probability models on the data.

Version: 0.95

### Content ###

`modelbase` can be used to model tabular data with generic probabilistic modelling as well to analyse, use and explore both, the fitted model as well as the data. To this end the fitted models offer different types of operations such as prediction, conditionalization or marginalization. Semantically equivalent operations, namely aggregation, row select and column selection are also available for data.
 
An overview over the capabilities of `modelbase` and a short introductory example of its Python API usage can be found in the jupyter-notebook files `doc/Intro_example.ipynb` and `doc/simple_API_usage.ipynb`.

We also developed [lumen](https://github.com/lumen-org/lumen), an interactive web-application for exploration, comparison and validation of probabilistic models and its data. `lumen` uses the webservice interface of `modelbase`. 

### Repository Overview ###

The `modelbase` repository contains a number directories as follows:

 * `bin`: This folder contains scripts to run an instance of the webservice-backend locally. In particular you may execute `webservice.py` to run the webservice as a local Flask app (see below) 
 * `dev`: This folder contains stuff only relevant for development.
 * `docs`: This folder contains documentation and introductions as jupyter notebooks.
  These runnable examples that serve as starting points for different use cases and tasks.
 * `cgmodsel`: Contains a required external python package (resolved as a git submodule).
 * `mb-*-pkg`: each is a namespace package under the common namespace `mb`.
 * `tests`: contains tests.

### The Lumen Project ###

`modelbase` is part of a larger project, namely [Lumen](https://github.com/lumen-org). Within `Lumen` there exist two main projects: the back-end [modelbase](https://github.com/lumen-org/modelbase) and the front-end [lumen](https://github.com/lumen-org/lumen). 

`modelbase` provides a generic modelling and querying backend, similar to what data base management systems are for tabular data alone. 

### Setup modelbase ###

**Requirements:**

 * Python3
 * jupyterlab or jupyternotebook is required to run the intro examples and many other tutorials. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions.
 * R may be required for some optional components.

**Setup:**

*Note: It is strongly recommended to use some virtual environment of python to install this software.* 

1. Clone this repository into a folder of your choice. Let's call it `<root>`.
2. Install other dependencies that are only available as git repositories (so called submodules):
    * Install the `cgmodsel` package with `git submodule init && git submodule update`
    * Install submodule `pip3 install cgmodsel` from `<root>`.
3. Install the base package `mb.modelbase` of the backend locally, i.e, do `cd <root>/mb-modelbase-pkg && pip3 install .`
4. Install the data package `mb.data`, i.e, do `cd <root>/mb-data-pkg && pip3 install .`
4. Run `bin/initialize.py`: this will create some simples models to start with in `bin/fitted_models`. This is also a sanity check that things are all right with your installation.    
    
**Setup of optional components:**
 
This project uses the namespace `mb`. 
In that namespace a number of packages exist.
Following the setup instructions above you just installed the core package 'mb.modelbase' and the data package 'mb.data'.
If you want to install additional optional components you simply install the corresponding namespace packages, analogous to above.

Note that these subpackages may have conflicting dependencies. 
Hence, you may not be able to install all components at once.
 
The following additional optional components and corresponding namespace packages exist.
Each of them provide an additional type of model to work with. 
 * `mb.pymc3`: Use probabilistic programs / statistical models written in the PyMC3 probabilistic programming language.   
 * `mb.stan`: Use probabilistic programs / statistical models written in the STAN probabilistic programming language.
 * `mb.gaussspn`: A gauss-SPN adapter. SPN stands for Sum-Product-Network.
 * `mb.libspn`: A libspn adapter.
 * `mb.mspn`: A mixed-SPN model adapter, based on some R package. Note that you need to install R for this to work.
 * `mb.spflow` A SPN-adapter based on the Python3 package spflow.
 
### Updating modelbase

Since you have installed `modelbase` as a number of packages in your local python installation, you have run the following for each of your packages in order to update it to the latest repository version.
 Here it is explained with the `mb.modelbase` core package

1. uninstall the current version of all .
 For instance for the core package to `pip uninstall mb.modelbase`
2. change into the local repository <root>/mb-modelbase-pkg
2. pull the latest version from the repo: `git pull origin master`
3. install the latest version: `pip3 install .`

Alternatively, you can use the `--editable` when installing the packages above. Then, you simply need to pull the latest version from the repo. 

### Using modelbase

`modelbase` provides three layers of APIs:

1. a webservice that accepts JSON-formatted http/https requests with a SQL inspired syntax.See 'Running the modelbase webservice' and 'configuring the modelbase webservice' below.
2. a python class `ModelBase`. 
An instance of that class is like a instance of a data base management system - just (also) for probabilistic models. Use its member methods to add, remove models and run queries against it. 
See the class documentation for more information.
3. a python class `Model`, which is the base class of all concrete models implemented in `modelbase'.
 A instance of such a class hence represents one particular model. See the class documentation for more information. Also 

### Running the modelbase webservice

This repository contains the code for the python package `mb_modelbase` (in the folder with identical name). If you followed the setup steps above this package is installed to your python environment. Apart from the package the repo also contains the `bin` directory which we will use to run the backend. 

There is two intended ways to run the modelbase backend.
1. execute `webservice.py`. This starts a simple Flask web server locally. _Note that this should not be used for production environments._
2. run it as an WSGI application with (for example) apache2. To this end, the `modelbase.wsgi` file is provided. 

When you start the webservice it will load the models from the directory you provided (see configuration options).

### Configuring the modelbase webservice

There is three ways to configure the backend. In order of precedence (highest to lowest):
  * use command line arguments to `webservice.py`.
   This cannot be used if you run modelbase as a WSGI application.
    See `webservice.py --help` for available options.
  * set options in `run_conf.cfg`. 
  This is respected by both ways of running `modelbase` (see above). 
  `run_conf.cfg` may have any subset of the options in `default_run_conf.cfg` and has the same format. 
  Note that `run_conf.cfg` does initially *not* exist after cloning the project.
  To find out what options are available, please see `default_run_conf.cfg`.
  * set options in `default_run_conf.cfg`. 
  Changing settings here is not recommended. 

#### Hosting models 

Notes:
 * once run the server does not immediately necessarily produce any output on the command line. *that is normal*.
 * don't forget to activate your custom environment, *if you configured one in the process above*.

### Development Setup

This section describes the _recommended_ development setup. 

We recommend using PyCharm as an IDE.
You can set the virtual python environment to use (if any specific) in PyCharm like [this](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ide_integration#pycharm).
Moreover, I recommend not installing it as a local package using the `--editable` option of pip. 
This makes your dev workflow much faster, because you do not need to update the local installation (doing an uninstall & reinstall)when you changed the code in the repository. See as follows:

1. setup public key authentication for the repository. This way you do not need to provide passwords when pulling/pushing.
2. clone repository to local machine into `<root>`
3. install [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
4. create python virtual environment for project 
   * using PyCharm IDE: open project -> settings -> project settings -> project interpreter -> add python interpreter
   * using pure virtual env: see [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#usage)
5. install like above in the setup instructions but with the `--editable` flag.
8. get the data repository [from here](https://ci.inf-i2.uni-jena.de/gemod/mb_data) and install it with the `--editable` flag as well.
   * This repository provides prepared data set and preset configurations to learn models from the data.
9. get the front-end [lumen](https://github.com/lumen-org/lumen)
   * you probably want the front-end as well. See the README of the repository for more details.
