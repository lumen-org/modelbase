Date: 2016-08-04


Shows how to do a cross join (i.e. cartesian product) between two pandas DataFrames using an example on
calculating the distances between origin and destination cities.

Tested with pandas 0.17.1 and 0.18 on Python 3.4 and Python 3.5

Best run this with Spyder (see https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)
